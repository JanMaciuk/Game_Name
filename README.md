# Space shot game

This is a relatively simple game written in python utilizing [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) for user interface and [Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) for running the game itself.

The main menu allows you to create player profiles and manage difficulty preferences. There is an auto difficulty mode which makes the game harder as you progress. All assets are licenced under creative commons licences and credits are given within the main game file. Player profiles are stored under /Profiles directory where a sample profile is provided. They are serialized json files which can be easily edited manually, however that shouldn't be necessary as all options are customizeable in the main menu.



## Running the game

Run Menu.py in python to launch the game, you can run the GameName.py file directly to skip configuration and use the default settings, however without a profile your progress won't be saved.
